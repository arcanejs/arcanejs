# @arcanejs/diff

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f50dc39: Reorder package exports to remove esbuild warnings

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a11d331: Allow diffing values of different types

  Previously, when there were different types for a value, we weren't able to
  compare then and provide a patch.
  Now it simply includes the entire new value.

- a11d331: Optimize value changes

  Don't include the previous value in a calculated diff when its entire value
  needs to be replaced, as this is not used to calculate the new value,
  and only serves to bloat the diff sizes.
