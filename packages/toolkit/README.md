# `@arcanejs/toolkit`

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40arcanejs%2Ftoolkit)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcanejs/toolkit)

This package provides the core functionality behind the ArcaneJS framework,
allowing you to quickly build single-process Node.js apps with
real-time interactive control panels that are exposed as web pages.

This library provides a tree-like API for creating & updating control panels,
and responding to user input.

We highly-recommend that rather than integrating with this library directly,
you make use of the
[`@arcanejs/react-toolkit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcanejs/react-toolkit)
library, that allows you to compose your control panels using server-side react.

please see the main documentation on our GitHub repository:
