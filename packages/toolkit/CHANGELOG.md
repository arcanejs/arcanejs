### Patch Changes

- 94d6467: Fix issue with fonts being re-downloaded

  As a result, there's a flash-of-unstyled-content during this time,
  which causes the whole layout to shift.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- f50dc39: Refactor event listener usage to use props
- 9d3919e: Allow for custom components to be defined

  This change comes with quite a few internal and architectural refactors to allow
  for custom components to be defied both in the `toolkit` and `react-toolkit`
  packages.

  Including:

  - Updating the protocol to include a namespace attribute for every component
  - Introducing the `FrontendComponentRenderer` interface in `toolkit-frontend`
  - Migrating the `core` components frontend implementation to
    `toolkit-frontend` as an instance of `FrontendComponentRenderer`
  - In `toolkit`: allowing for custom frontend entrypoint javascript files to be
    loaded instead of the default one
    (which only includes the core `FrontendComponentRenderer`).
  - Migrating logic handling for adding / removing listeners based on props into
    `toolkit` backend modules rather than having hard-coded handling in
    `react-toolkit`.
  - Refactoring `react-toolkit` to allow for component namespaces to be defined,
    by:
    - Introducing a new component registry concept,
      and exposing a helper function `prepareComponents` to create components
      object that can be used directly in react.
    - Migrating all core-component-specific logic to use this new registry logic.
  - Introducing an example app (`custom-components`)
    that defines a custom component, and demonstrates usage, including:
    - receiving messages from users
    - nesting and displaying other components
    - using `ref` to directly interact with the backend implementation

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a053abb: **BREAKING:** Update Switch and SliderButton to support controlled/uncontrolled

  Update the properties for both SliderButton and Switch so that they can both
  maintain internal state, and also support being explicitly controlled:

  - For controlled inputs: `value` should be used
  - For uncontrolled inputs:

    - `defaultValue` can be used to set the initial value
    - The value of the input will change automatically,
      but if it needs to be overridden,
      `ref` can be used along with `setValue()`.

  `TextInput` is not affected by this change as it always needs to maintain an
  uncontrolled experience in the frontend, and we need to think-through a bit how
  this will work in the backend.
